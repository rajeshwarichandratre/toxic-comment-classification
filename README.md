# CS271-Toxic Comment Classification
Toxic Comment Clasiification 

All the files only contains the output of each part of the project.

MLModels.ipynb contains the implementation of the  Machine Learning models:
a) SVC
b) KNN
c) XGBoost
d) MultinomialNB
e) LSTM

DataVisualization.ipynb file contains the output of the data visualization techniques used.


The files would not run in on their own and would require the dependent files. Please download the required files at the following link for the full execution of the models. Also dataset is available here :

Note: While running LSTM please create a folder saved_models for save the trained LSTM model.

The code is dependent on following packages:
numpy
pandas
sklearn
gensim
nltk
tensorflow
matplotlib
seaborn
imblearn
XGBoost
cython
